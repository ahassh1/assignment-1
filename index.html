        The full verdict of the Appellate Division has revealed that there were no legal flaws in the High Court's decision to cancel five labour law cases filed against Interim Government Adviser and Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus, and no need for interference was found.
        On Saturday, the three-judge Appellate Division, led by Justice Md Ashfaqul Islam, dismissed the State's leave-to-appeal request against the High Court's ruling. Dr Yunus’ lawyer, Barrister Mustafizur Rahman, later confirmed the order.</p>
